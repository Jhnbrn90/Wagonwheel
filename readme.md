# Wagonwheel
Offer an online version of all of your Laravel emails to your users.

Wagonwheel uses Laravel's built-in temporary signed URLs to create the URL for the online version. This means it's secured by your app's encryption key, as well as making it difficult to guess.

You can customise the template however you like, making it highly customisable.

For the basic setup, all you need to add is a trait to your Mailable.
